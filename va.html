  <p>If you ever visit Virginia, Tyson's Corner Mall is definitely a must-see location. There are two different
    locations for Tyson's Corner Mall. One includes extremely high-end brand stores such as Chanel, Louis Vuitton, and
    many more. The other one is a regular mall; however, it still comprises three different stories of retail stores.

  <p>If you ever visit Virginia, Chincoteague Island is the next must-see location. Chincoteague Island is also known as
    the Horse Island because it is home to so many beautiful horses. I remember I was going to a McDonald's, and there
    was a farm of horses right by the restaurant. We were able to feed and pet the horses at a low cost of 25 cents! In addition to these creatures, Chincoteague Island is surrounded by beaches, which are both warm and clean! I
    would definitely recommend going during the summer if you can! Also, go before 12 pm because parking is incredibly
    hard there.</p>
