      <p>Living near Glenstone Museum has been a delightful discovery. Not only is it conveniently close to home, but it
        also offers an enchanting setting for memorable dates, fantastic photo opportunities, and the best part—it won't
        cost you a dime! Let me share why Glenstone is my local gem. What truly sets Glenstone apart is that it offers all of this at no cost. That's right—free admission! You can
        enjoy a day of art, nature, and togetherness without breaking the bank. It's a fantastic option for those looking to
        have a great time without the financial strain.</p>

       <p>Did you know that schools in Maryland open really late because of Ocean City? The state wants people to visit as
        long as they can when it's warm, so they delay school openings! At least that's the tale I heard. I have been to
        Ocean City twice, and it might not be my favorite beach, but there are so many things to do there, honestly. For
        example, the boardwalk, the beach, mini golf, and more. They have so many souvenir shops too, and they are so cheap.
        I have seen stores that sell sweatshirts for $5 each. I would recommend going to Ocean City and renting an Airbnb
        with friends. It's a super fun beach weekend you will never forget!.</p>
