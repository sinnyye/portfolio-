  <h2>Hi everyone! Welcome to Sinny's Travel Guide to the DMV:</h2>
  <p>My name is Sinny Ye, and I have been a resident of Maryland for essentially my entire life. Maryland is
    definitely one of those states that few people are familiar with, but I have truly grown to love my home. I
    originally lived in Carroll County, Maryland, but I moved to Montgomery County, Maryland when I was in middle
    school. In case you're not aware, Montgomery County is very close to DC and Virginia, approximately a 20-minute
    drive from both. That's why our area is also known as the DMV. Throughout high school, I made it my mission to
    live life to the fullest, and because of that, I was able to explore so much of the DMV area. From taking
    late-night trips to DC to grabbing a quick bite in Virginia, there are plenty of fun and cool places in the DMV,
    and it's all about knowing the right local to guide you. That's where I come in!</p>

  <h2> What Is the DMV?</h2>

  <p>For those of you who are not residents of the DMV, the term "DMV area" typically refers to the Washington, D.C.
    metropolitan area. This region encompasses the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.) itself, as well as parts
    of Maryland and Virginia that surround the nation's capital. It is home to a wide variety of communities and
    neighborhoods that offer rich history, delicious dining options, parks, and numerous enjoyable travel
    destinations. The DMV area attracts many visitors from all around the country who come to explore our nation's
    capital. However, they often wonder what else they can do after arriving. They've come a long way, so what's
    next? At Sinny's Travel Guide, you can discover all the unique places that I, as a DMV resident, have explored
    and fallen in love with. I hope this resource simplifies your travel plans and enhances your enjoyment of your
    time here!</p>

  <h2>Transportation Fun Fact (The Metro):</h2>

  <p> Similar to the subway in New York City, the Metro is an underground train system that operates throughout the
    DMV area. It stands as one of the busiest and most renowned subway systems in the United States. The Washington
    Metro comprises six color-coded lines: Red, Blue, Orange, Silver, Green, and Yellow. Each line boasts multiple
    stations, serving various parts of the D.C. metropolitan area, including Washington, D.C., Maryland, and
    Virginia. This convenience is especially valuable for those who cannot drive or prefer to avoid the challenges
    of parking.
